What does it do?
----------------

Simplify your USaver and Ultra account statements into a single statement.


What problem does it address?
-----------------------------

[UBank](https://www.ubank.com.au), an online bank in Australia, offers
a product called "USaver Ultra" which is a high interest savings account
paired with a transaction account. It's easy to operate, because the
transaction account is *automatically* topped up from the saving account.
But it's painful to read the account statements, because the automatic
top-up (or "sweep") transactions outnumber the real transactions.

It's particularly frustrating if you want to record your personal
finances, and reconcile them against your bank statements.


What's the solution?
--------------------

You really don't care which of the two accounts your money is in. You
just want to know what goes in and what comes out. Conceptually, you
treat your "USaver Ulta" as a single account. And by using this program,
you can combine your online transaction statements for the "USaver" and
"Ultra" accounts into a single statement. By omitting the movement of
funds between the two accounts (both automatic "sweeps" or manual
transfers), you can concentrate on what's important: deposits and
withdrawals.
